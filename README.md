# Implementation of an autonomous vehicle using machine learning techniques and a low-power computer system
## Description
- Developed an autonomous driving system based on Deep Learning methods implemented in Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB. Built a vehicle using a 4WD car chassis kit, a webcam, an ultrasonic distance sensor, and other electronic components.
- A Convolutional Neural Network model takes raw input images and outputs the corresponding steering angles. The model is trained and evaluated using data collected by driving the vehicle in a test track under various conditions.
- The vehicle uses a distance sensor to react immediately to unanticipated obstacles by automatically controlling its speed.
- Experimental results show that the vehicle can autonomously navigate on the test track.
